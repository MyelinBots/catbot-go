CatBot is a lightweight and modular IRC bot built in Go (Golang), designed to bring fun, personality, and a little cat magic to your IRC channels. At the heart of CatBot is Purrito — a virtual cat with moods, memory, and a love meter that tracks how each user treats them. CatBot listens to user messages, reacts in real-time, and remembers how much love (or trouble!) you have given to Purrito.

🧡 The Love Meter – Yes, Purrito Has Feelings 🧡
Every user has a personal love meter ranging from 0% to 100%. This meter reflects how much Purrito trusts and likes you based on your interactions.
