# 🐾 CatBot — The IRC Cat Companion

CatBot is a lightweight and modular IRC bot built in Go (Golang), designed to bring fun, personality, and a little cat magic to your IRC channels.  

At the heart of CatBot is **Purrito** — a virtual cat with moods, memory, and a love meter that tracks how each user treats them. CatBot listens to user messages, reacts in real-time, and remembers how much love (or trouble!) you have given to Purrito.

## 🧡 The Love Meter — Yes, Purrito Has Feelings 🧡
Every user has a personal love meter ranging from 0% to 100%. This meter reflects how much Purrito trusts and likes you based on your interactions.

---

### Commands
- `!pet purrito` – Pet Purrito and build your bond  
- `!love purrito` – Check your current love level with Purrito  

That’s it! How Purrito responds depends on your love level. No two reactions are exactly the same 🐱

## ✨ Features
- 🐱 Written in idiomatic Go with a clean modular architecture  
- 🐱 Tracks love level per user — Purrito remembers each person
